## Wayton Pilkin
The coach of Boise State RL and the goat of rocket league content. Wayton is a personal favorite youtuber of mine and has taught me a quite a bit of what I know about rocket league from his youtube videos. I will link his channel and a couple of his videos.

### Wayton's Channel

### Videos I recommend

- This isn't as important for right now but this video goes over effective air dribbling techniques
    - [How I scored on SSLs with one basic mechanic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urLw4HPazf8)

- He follows a routine that a pro may follow that involves being active inside and outside of the game. Mostly an interesting watch but may give some ideas on what you might want to do when warming up/practicing in game (as I bet you two are already in a pretty good consistent schedule outside of the game :p)
    - [I Used A Pro Training Routine For A Week...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKQLFexy1DQ)

- Good breakdown of why I am keeping the more advanced stuff like air dribbles towards the end when I can verify that the basics are mastered because a lot of "flashy" mechanics and tools are not that important in comparison to simply being a smarter player. The only mechanics that are the most important are mainly simple interactions with the ball that allow you to atleast hit it well and towards the area you want it to go.
    - [Mechanics in Rocket League DON'T actually matter, Here's Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SArfqvuOt0)

- A really good tips video that I actually had saved inside my old google doc. They are general tips so may contain things that wouldn't fully help with level we are at but are helpful to keep in mind either way.
    - [32 Mistakes You're Probably Making in Rocket League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IpkoO9GUZY)

- Another tips video, yet another banger. Honestly I'd say if you want to watch any sort of tips videos just watch Wayton, I truly believe no one else makes as good of tips videos as Wayton, or atleast not as consistenly as he does.
    - [What I learned after 7000 hours of Rocket League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7kX_zil4Ts)

- Tips video, you get the drill, except more rank specific and comes with a little timeline for each rank! I used to follow this timeline when I was plat and I'd say it is pretty accurate to what each rank should be learning.

- There are quite a bit of videos I did not list so I recommend checking out this playlist, it contains every tips/tutorial video he is made and you will see a lot of the videos I linked are in there. I avoided most of them because there are a lot aimed at champ players or higher but there are also videos that aren't fully aimed at those level of players that you might benefit from watching.

## ApparentlyJack/ApparentlyJack Analysis
MY GOOOOAAATTTTT- I mean- *ahem* Pro EU player currently playing for Dignitas that makes tons of videos playing 2s and 1s. He is currently teaming up with a caster, Johnnyboi, to make a paid course for improvement called The Next Rank. I will get into The Next Rank later (not the paid course but the free youtube videos they upload) but Jack's videos are also very nice to watch as he describes everything he does while playing and why he's making his decision as well as points out mistakes he makes and what he should have done instead. He also has a second channel called ApparentlyJack Analysis where he analyzes his twitch sub's replays. They are also good videos to watch as sometimes you may find players who could reflect some of the same issues you may be having as well.

### Videos I recommend

- I absoultely love love love love **LOVE** AppJack's mindset and his videos where he just talks about what he has learnt and what he thinks sould be the way people should approach improving at this game. He is very smart and I will link the 3 videos he has made where he just talks about improvement for about 20ish minutes straight and is packed full of good information. You do not *have* to watch these videos but they are imo really nice to watch in general if you have the time. They might repeat info because they are all similar style of videos covering the same topic coing from the same person but each one might have something he doesn't go over in the other.

- This is the lowest ranked replay review I could find but it is a good watch overall because he covers things that most players in that level will want to improve on

## The Next Rank
Collaborative effort by both Apparentlyjack and Johnnyboi to offer resources to players from high gold - low GC1 on improving both mechanically and gamesense wise. I suggest ***NOT*** buying the course because I believe paying money for coaching or resources is not a good idea no matter what as they are **TONS** of resouces for free on youtube and maybe even spread out wildly on different social media platforms. I won't link any videos as all of the videos on the channel currently are good to watch as they all cover good information, well, maybe except for the QnA one as there are a few questions in that video mainly related to the course they are selling.
