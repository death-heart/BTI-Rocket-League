# Power Shots
---
## Intro

Power shots are one of the fundamental ways of scoring in rocket league and is most commonly seen in 1s gameplay. If you can master shooting the ball with a lot of power anywhere on the net (top left, bottom right, etc.) you are fully capable of making shots that are completely unsaveable depending on how disadvantaged your opponent is in their position. With 2s gameplay having a lot of mini 1v1s power shots are still seen a decent amount and are very effective ways of scoring. If you have not already I suggest reading [PartsOfCar.md](PartsOfCar.md) as knowing about the nose and utilizing it will help with this section.

## Flipping

- When going for a power shot knowing when the flip is *extremely* important. If you mistime your flip you are not maximizing the amount of power you are putting into the ball which can make the shot you are going for still saveable. The focus should be to flip *into* the ball. Then only contact you should be making with the ball is when you flip and not after and/or before you flip.

- Here you can see a good example of flipping into the ball. This gives the ball a lot of power (101kph) when I shoot it into the net.

- In this example I flip after making contact with the ball, this basically equates to if I had just single jumped into the ball and then flipped to recover. This produces very little power

- In this example I flip before I make contact with the ball, this produces more power than the previous example, but not enough in comparison to the proper execution of flipping into the ball.

## When and How

Stupid title again, but let me explain. Once you are at a point where you are able to consistently hit the ball with the nose of your car with a lot of power, you will want to start controlling where the ball gets placed into the net. Knowing how and when to hit the ball helps a lot in these cases as this allows you to place the ball into an unsaveable spot on the net. Also, hitting the ball at certain points will produce even more power than just hitting it plainly. So lets start with the When, and then we will get into the How.

### When to Hit

- There are multiple points when you can hit the ball, but there are two primary points where hitting the ball will produce the most amount of power
