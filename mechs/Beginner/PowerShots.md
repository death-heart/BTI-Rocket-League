# Power Shots
---
## Intro

Power shots are one of the fundamental ways of scoring in rocket league and is most commonly seen in 1s gameplay. If you can master shooting the ball with a lot of power anywhere on the net (top left, bottom right, etc.) you are fully capable of making shots that are completely unsaveable depending on how disadvantaged your opponent is in their position. With 2s gameplay having a lot of mini 1v1s power shots are still seen a decent amount and are very effective ways of scoring. If you have not already I suggest reading [PartsOfCar.md](PartsOfCar.md) as knowing about the nose and utilizing it will help with this section.

## Flipping

- When going for a power shot knowing when the flip is *extremely* important. If you mistime your flip you are not maximizing the amount of power you are putting into the ball which can make the shot you are going for still saveable. The focus should be to flip *into* the ball. Then only contact you should be making with the ball is when you flip and not after and/or before you flip.
