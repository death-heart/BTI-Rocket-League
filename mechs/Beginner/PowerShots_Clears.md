# Power Shots
---
## Intro

Power shots are one of the fundamental ways of scoring in rocket league and is most commonly seen in 1s gameplay. If you can master shooting the ball with a lot of power anywhere on the net (top left, bottom right, etc.) you are fully capable of making shots that are completely unsaveable depending on how disadvantaged your opponent is in their position. With 2s gameplay having a lot of mini 1v1s power shots are still seen a decent amount and are very effective ways of scoring. If you have not already I suggest reading [PartsOfCar.md](PartsOfCar.md) as knowing about the nose and utilizing it will help with this section.

## Flipping

- When going for a power shot knowing when the flip is *extremely* important. If you mistime your flip you are not maximizing the amount of power you are putting into the ball which can make the shot you are going for still saveable. The focus should be to flip *into* the ball. Then only contact you should be making with the ball is when you flip and not after and/or before you flip.

- Here you can see a good example of flipping into the ball. This gives the ball a lot of power (101kph) when I shoot it into the net.

- In this example I flip after making contact with the ball, this basically equates to if I had just single jumped into the ball and then flipped to recover. This produces very little power

- In this example I flip before I make contact with the ball, this produces more power than the previous example, but not enough in comparison to the proper execution of flipping into the ball.

## When and How

Stupid title again, but let me explain. Once you are at a point where you are able to consistently hit the ball with the nose of your car with a lot of power, you will want to start controlling where the ball gets placed into the net. Knowing how and when to hit the ball helps a lot in these cases as this allows you to place the ball into an unsaveable spot on the net. Also, hitting the ball at certain points will produce even more power than just hitting it plainly. So lets start with the When, and then we will get into the How.

### When to Hit

- There are multiple points when you can hit the ball, but there are two primary points where hitting the ball will produce the most amount of power

- The first point is right when the ball bounces on the ground. This same point is used to do power clears. Not only does this produce a lot of power, but it also produces height.

- The second point is right before the ball hits the ground. This produces no height but a lot of power, sometimes more than if you were to wait for the ball to bounce. This is good if you want to shoot the ball low to the ground towards a bottom corner of the net.

### How to Hit

Rocket league is an extremely free form game so there are no set guidelines on how to hit the ball beyond the basics of hitting it with your nose for the most control and power on the ball. However, if there is confusion on the usage of when to hit the ball or how to approach angles there are some things that you can keep in mind.

- When wanting to go for height on the ball, going for the first point when the ball has just bounced on the ground will give you the most height. This allows you to go for shots in the top corner of the net. You may also run into moments where the ball is slightly higher up on the ground and you'll have to jump up for the ball and hit it. If you still want height in this situation you'll want to hit towards the bottom of the ball so that it goes upwards. This part of the ball will also be used for air dribbles if we get into them.

    - You can see the part of the ball you want to aim for if you want height in any situation 

- When going for power shots and wanting to hit the ball towards the left/right, you will want to utilize the corners of the car. You can see what part of the car this is in the [PartsOfCar.md](PartsOfCar.md) section. What will also help is approaching the ball from the side, and sometimes single jumping and air rolling so that you can hit the ball with the corner of your car. Once again, [PartsOfCar.md](PartsOfCar.md) for an example of this.

## Practice Methods

The best way to practice power shots is either through setting them up through bounce dribbles, off of kick off, or through packs. Bounce dribbles I will get into in the intermediate mechanics section, so we will skip those for now. These next 4 videos will showcase how you can set up power shots off of kick off in training mode.

The main focus is to tap the ball with a enough speed so that it pops into the air and you can practice doing the different methods I mentioned when going for power shots.

I will now give a list of training packs that I think are good to practice power shots, if they have a video on them I will include that as well

- [7028-5E10-88EF-E83E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuU3xBELMbA) (it also has some power clear/aerial setups at the end :3)
- [3B69-B8C9-D4B2-A7E3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlREKdyuy7k) (these are a little more advanced and involve some saves so if you can't do them all don't feel bad, just come back later)
- [B4EB-C56A-BA9D-5300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIdKX7JZQxE) (air roll ground shots c:)
- [137F-0F44-6FA1-91EE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE1ZnHtKKlA) (more focused on shooting but still includes some good setups for going for power shots)

# Power Clears
---
## Intro(? sort of?) (Disclaimer?)

Honestly, if you can do power shots, you can do power clears. If you can do power clears, you can do power shots. They are basically one in the same as both involve similar strategies and methods. The main thing with power clears is that you will want to go for a lot of height and power as your aim is to get the ball out of your half of the field. 

## Practice Methods

When practicing power clears you are going to be doing similar methods to practicing power shots, except you will be on one half of the field and focusing on hitting the ball the moment it leaves the ground to get both power and height. You can also do this by hitting the ball against the wall, reading it, and hitting it again the same exact way. Below will be a video of both of these methods.
