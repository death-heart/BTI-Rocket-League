# Hitting the ball good
---
## Intro

The title may be a little stupid but at a lower level I commonly see mistakes of players making touches on the ball that are simply not good. You may think that there is no baseline to how to hit the ball, but if you want the most control and power while hitting the ball there are a few things to keep in mind that will help you understand how you should be approaching hitting the ball. Once these guidelines are set going for things like power clears/shots will make a lot more sense as well as soft control touches.
