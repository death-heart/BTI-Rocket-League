# Bounce Dribbling
---
## Intro

OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY !!! I love bounce dribbling and in my opinion it is one of the most effective ways of setting up threatening positions and scoring opportunities. It allows for a large amount of options and makes it extremely difficult for your opponent to challenge you as it is very easy to just low 50 the ball and then get an open net. It is an extremely simple mechanic, but difficult to master and become highly effective with. This section will be short but please please please spend time practicing and utilizing this mechanic because I promise you it will allow for a lot of scoring opportunities

Alright glaze session over back to business-

## What is it

Bounce dribbling can be seen similarly to dribbling in basket ball. You are bouncing the ball on the ground and controlling it around the field, maintaining posession and setting yourself up in a position to score. To get an idea I will link some videos of okhalid, one of the best 1v1 players in the world to utilize bounce dribbling, doing it. Before moving on to the next part, pay attention to when he hits the ball and how he sets himself up when he is going for a shot.

- [okhalid vs joreuz](https://youtu.be/QVhPBVroxls?si=2Vu2GDXLL0Y4fRT9&t=362) (doesn't even touch the ball but the *threat* that he could touch it at any point and even shoot it is enough to make it a very scary position for joreuz)

## How to do it

There are multiple ways you can touch the ball to start bouncing it. You can use the sides, nose, or corners of your car. Knowing when and how to use the different parts of your car to bounce dribble is a part of mastering bounce dribbling as it allows you to make it more dangerous and much harder to read what you are doing and when you are doing it. 

Of course, doing it with your nose gives you the most control and helps with going for a power shot at the end, but as you add more ground options to your utility belt, you may not want to always go for a power shot. It makes your offense easier to read and you limit how threatening you are as a player.

Below will be videos of me bounce dribbling the ball with different parts of my car and then going for a power shot at the end. Take note of when I touch the ball and how close I keep it to me.
