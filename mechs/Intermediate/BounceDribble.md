# Bounce Dribbling
---
## Intro

OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY !!! I love bounce dribbling and in my opinion it is one of the most effective ways of setting up threatening positions and scoring opportunities. It allows for a large amount of options and makes it extremely difficult for your opponent to challenge you as it is very easy to just low 50 the ball and then get an open net. It is an extremely simple mechanic, but difficult to master and become highly effective with. This section will be short but please please please spend time practicing and utilizing this mechanic because I promise you it will allow for a lot of scoring opportunities

Alright glaze session over back to business-

## What is it

Bounce dribbling can be seen similarly to dribbling in basket ball. You are bouncing the ball on the ground and controlling it around the field, maintaining posession and setting yourself up in a position to score. To get an idea I will link some videos of okhalid, one of the best 1v1 players in the world to utilize bounce dribbling, doing it. Before moving on to the next part, pay attention to when he hits the ball and how he sets himself up when he is going for a shot.

- [okhalid vs joreuz](https://youtu.be/QVhPBVroxls?si=2Vu2GDXLL0Y4fRT9&t=362) (doesn't even touch the ball but the *threat* that he could touch it at any point and even shoot it is enough to make it a very scary position for joreuz)

## How to do it

There are multiple ways you can touch the ball to start bouncing it. You can use the sides, nose, or corners of your car. Knowing when and how to use the different parts of your car to bounce dribble is a part of mastering bounce dribbling as it allows you to make it more dangerous and much harder to read what you are doing and when you are doing it. 

Of course, doing it with your nose gives you the most control and helps with going for a power shot at the end, but as you add more ground options to your utility belt, you may not want to always go for a power shot. It makes your offense easier to read and you limit how threatening you are as a player.

Below will be videos of me bounce dribbling the ball with different parts of my car and then going for a power shot at the end. Take note of when I touch the ball and the control I have.

Here are some things to note:

- Each time I went to hit the ball, it was *after* it had bounced. If I had done it too early, before it had bounced, it would have landed on my car and seized its bouncing momentum. If I had done it too late, I would have given the ball more height. Neither of these are inherently bad, you may want to do some of these at some points when bounce dribbling, but if going specifically for the setup shown in the videos, they may be bad if done unintentionally and can throw you off or ruin your dribble/power shot.
- When I bounce dribbled with the sides of my car, I was going a bit slower, I also switched sides and didn't have the most control on the ball. The sides of the car don't give me the most control when bounce dribbling, but it makes it easier to give the ball height and/or switch sides. I can still do this with the other methods, but doing it with different parts of the car makes it harder to figure out what I am going for
- While bounce dribbling, I was approaching the net at an angle, this allows me to have the most options available to me when shooting as I can shoot the ball almost anywhere on net.

## Practice Methods

For practicing bounce dribbles you basically want to do what I was doing in the videos shown in [How to do it](#how-to-do-it). You simply just want to do the mechanic, focus on hitting the ball when it bounces and controlling it towards the net. You may not even want to control it towards the net for a power shot all the time, you could just bounce dribble the ball around the field just to get used to the action. Or, as you gain more ground options, instead of going for a power shot at the end of your bounce dribble you could practice bounce dribbling into a flick or maybe an aerial play. Once again, rocket league is extremely free form and what I show and teach shouldn't always be taken as hard guidelines. Having creative expression in this game is an absolute blessing and can make you more of a threatening player on offense. So I *heavily* encourage you to experiment with this mechanic and figure out what you like doing and what you can do with it.

I also recommend not sticking to bounce dribbling with only one part of the car, forcing yourself to only use the corners or sides shouldn't be what you practice, instead figure out when you should use a different part of the car by practicing the mechanic and understanding how you should be controlling the ball when bounce dribbling it.

Below I will show a video of me bounce dribbling the ball around the field for reference of practice
