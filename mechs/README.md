# Mechanics

Mechanics are the core of rocket league, the pro scene is in an execution meta and every pro is consistent at practically every mechanic they do. Of course we are not pro level players but there are some ***extremely*** important mechanics that players at every level should know, practice, or learn.

## Beginning

We aren't going to dive right into anything advanced because trying to learn to flip reset before even knowing how to rotate and hit the ball well is just a death trap that is the reason a lot of players are hard stuck in their rank or are capped in the learning capability until they humble up. So for the beginning we will focus primarily on interacting with the ball at a fundamental level such as hitting the ball with the nose of the car, flipping into the ball, and controlling how hard or soft we hit the ball. As you learn these fundamentals things like controlling the ball will start to make sense and you may start feeling inclined to try and go for controlling plays. I will not advise against these as it will be the focus of the next part, I would advise not focusing too hard on only controlling the ball at all times as this is the trap of the 1s mindset, in 2s controlling the ball is good but sometimes a good clear from one half of the field to the next or a bang out mid for your teammate to score off of is a lot better multiple different scenarios.
